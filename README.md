# LIGA - Library for Geometric Algebra

This is a basic package in beta stage for programming using
Geometric Algebra. This kind of representation provide several advantages.

A good review of *State of Art* and applications can be found in

There are others libraries with the same purpose, but we decide to create ours for a correct understanding of this subject.
Evidently, we are sharing our studies with all interested person.
